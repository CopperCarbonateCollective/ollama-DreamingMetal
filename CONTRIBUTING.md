# Contributing to Ollama-DreamingMetal

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Ollama-DreamingMetal. 

## Set up (Same as original Ollama repo--so far)

See the [development documentation](./docs/development.md) for instructions on how to build and run Ollama locally.

### Bug fixes

If you find a bug, know what the fix is, and care to submit it, we thank you.</br>
If you find a bug, and just want to let us know, you are welcome to do so in the discussion board.

### Features and TODO's

If you have a good idea for how to implement a feature we've stated is still a TODO or possible future addition, and would like to do it, just check to make sure we're not already mid-progress on it first and you're welcome to make a branch for yourself to do so.</br>
Same goes for a feature that may have been requested that you'd like to see as well--so long as its in-line with what we're trying to do with this fork. </br>E.G. this isn't the fork for you if you'd like to see a stricter sandbox or something.</br>
