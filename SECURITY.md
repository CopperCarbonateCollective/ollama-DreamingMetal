# Security

What we're trying to do here may inherently make some aspects of the original project slightly less secure, especially if you're scared your language model may have it out for you, or they're conspiring behind your back.
That said, there are alwaays unintentional bugs or oversights that may need to be addressed.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, you can email CuCO2Collective@gmail.com, or post in the discussion as any other bug

Besides the normal things everyone wants:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Your assessment of the potential impact
- Any possible mitigations
We'd also want to check if the bug exists in the original application, or if it's verified to be a change we made. Within reason--we know not everyone is a code-monkey and could figure out what code is the root cause.
